## üìù Project Description

This project is an advanced AI assistant that interacts with users only when their face is detected. It combines computer vision, speech recognition, and state-of-the-art AI to provide a truly hands-free and interactive experience. All responses are spoken aloud using realistic TTS voices!

### üîÑ How It Works

1. **Face Detection**  
   Uses the [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) library to detect when a person's face is present.

2. **Speech Input (STT)**  
   Once a face is detected, the user can ask questions using their voice. Speech is transcribed using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper).

3. **Intelligent Response System**  
   - If the user asks about the time, weather, or wants to play YouTube videos (Linux only), the program handles those directly.
   - For general questions, the input is sent to OpenAI‚Äôs RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model, which answers based on the provided data sets (PDF).

4. **Text-to-Speech Output**  
   The response is spoken back to the user using [ElevenLabs TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/) for realistic, human-like voices.
